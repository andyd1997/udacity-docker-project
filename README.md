## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

###  explanation of the files in the repository
1. Docker file - Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile -- a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions which you can find at Dockerfile reference.
2. Run_Docker.sh - This file get Docker running locally
3. ./make_prediction.sh - This shell script is responsible for sending some input data to your containerized application via the appropriate port. Each numerical value in here represents some feature that is important for determining the price of a house in Boston. The source code is responsible for passing that data through a trained, machine learning model, and giving back a predicted value for the house price.
4. app.py - contains the application code
5. upload_docker - This file allows you to - Push image to a docker repository
6. run_kubernetes.sh - allows you to deploy into kubernetes - This script should create a pod with a name you specify and you may get an initial output that looks as follows, with a cluster and status:

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl
